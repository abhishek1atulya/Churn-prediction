# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a customer churning. Through a detailed analysis and application of various tree-based methods, we seek to understand the key factors influencing customer churn and predict future churn events. This project covers several parts, including data importing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), churn analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**
   - Goal: Predict customer churn.
   - Complete the listed tasks to achieve the project objectives.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - **Part 0: Imports and Data Loading** - Initial setup and data ingestion.
   - **Part 1: Quick Data Check** - Preliminary data inspection.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis** - In-depth data exploration including general feature examination.

4. **Churn Analysis**
   - **Part 3: Churn Analysis** - Analyzing churn through various perspectives and creating cohorts based on tenure.

5. **Predictive Modeling**
   - **Part 4: Predictive Modeling** - Developing and evaluating predictive models including:
     - Single Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Boosted Trees
     - Insights on model performance and selection.

## Key Findings

- The AdaBoostClassifier provided the best baseline performance, though further tuning and comparison are necessary.
- The exploratory data analysis and churn analysis sections provide valuable insights into customer behavior and characteristics associated with higher churn rates.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Import the necessary libraries as listed in Part 0 and follow the instructions in each section. The dataset used for this project is essential for running the code cells, so make sure it is properly loaded as indicated.
